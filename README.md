# anti-facebook-social-network

I've used a combination of mongo,express and node to make the backend of a facebook imitation app. It allows you to make friends, post blogs/statuses/, react to others posts and to delete both the blogs and reactions. I made this app because people are tired of facebook and twitter and I hope to build a new app that will replace them.I want this app to bring people together and expand the human experience or allow people to fight online more. Creating this app taught me a lot about using Mongo db.
